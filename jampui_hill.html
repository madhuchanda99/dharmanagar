            <p> Jampui Hills is a hill range located in the North Tripura district in the north eastern part of the Indian state of Tripura. The average altitude of the hill range is approximately 1000 metres above sea level. </p>
            <p> Jampui Hills is situated about 200 Km. away from Agartala and is the highest hill range in the state bordering Mizoram. This permanent seat of eternal spring is situated at an altitude of 3000’ above sea level. During November every year, the unique Orange & Tourism festival is celebrated in the Jampui hill. A large number of tourists, both domestic and foreign, participate and enjoy this festival. The rainy season is no less charming. During this season the hill is covered with floating clouds and it provides a rare experience for the tourists. The formation of clouds at the bottom of the hill range and its gradual ascendance from the bottom to the top slowly engulfing the whole hill range in its mystic lap is an experience to treasure.
            <p> The view of rising and setting sun from various viewpoints in Jampui hills is a wonderful sight for the tourists. Tourists visiting the Jampui hill cannot afford to miss the view of the sunset and the sunrise. Various viewpoints in the hill range provide excellent panoramic views of the valley and villages of Mizoram. From the watchtower at the highest peak, Betlingchip(3200 feet high), the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the Kanchanpur – Dasda valley other hill ranges of Tripura and Mizoram unfold an enigmatic scenic vista.</p>               
            <p> Tourist Department of Government of Tripura has constructed one very modern tourist lodge- ‘Eden Tourist Lodge’ at Vanghmun village in the Jampui hills which has a capacity of 20 persons and is well equipped with all modern amenities. In addition, local hospitable Mizo people also extend “Paying Guest” Accommodation facilities in their houses.</p>
            <p> For facilitating the visit of tourists to Jampui hill, Tourist Department, Government of Tripura is organizing various package tours from the capital town of Agartala. Jampui hill is a real tourist paradise which attracts a large number of tourists with its virgin forests and peaceful and eco-friendly ambience including beautiful orchids and colourful dance & music. Being sparsely populated it provides an ideal opportunity for leisure tourism.</p>
